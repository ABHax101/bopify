To add songs to the site, upload them to the mp3 folder. The file name should follow the naming scheme:
`[Artist - SongName].mp3`
Don't forget the brackets, and remember that it's 'space, hyphen, space'. Most audio types that are supported by the web audio api should work but I wouldn't count on it. Try to stick to mp3 files.
